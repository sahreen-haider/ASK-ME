# ASK-ME

ASK-ME is a conversational search app which helps you in finding the best solution
for you queries.

It has access to OpenAI API and Serpapi

In the backend it uses GPT 3.5 and Serpapi to achieve results from google search engine


it can search from google search engine and produce you the results in a more detailed or breif way using the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 reasoning capability

Moreover the POC is deployed using streamlit and over its cloud.

## You can access the web app using the url given below:
[https://askmeapp.streamlit.app/](url)

### Features
- up to date knowledge
- results from internet.

With contious searching an error might occur,
Because the app still uses free trail versions of both the software, which itself comes with limitations,
So if you encounter a "rate limit error" or any other error, Please wait for atleast 3 minutes before using it again.


## The project is still under Progress, Will try to update it soon
